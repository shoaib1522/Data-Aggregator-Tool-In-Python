# Data Aggregator Tool in Python

This project is an implementation of a Smart Data Aggregator tool using Python. The tool is designed to efficiently manage and analyze large sets of user data, supporting various tasks such as real-time analytics, data tracking, and reporting. 

## Features

The Data Aggregator Tool includes modules that handle data using different Python collections:

- **Lists**: For processing user data by filtering, sorting, and detecting duplicates.
- **Tuples**: For managing immutable transaction data, finding unique users, and identifying high-value transactions.
- **Sets**: For handling unique user IDs and tracking page visits across different pages.
- **Dictionaries**: For aggregating and analyzing user feedback with nested data structures.

## Tasks

### Part 1: User Data Processing with Lists
- Filter users by specific criteria and sort by age.
- Identify users with duplicate names.

### Part 2: Immutable Data Management with Tuples
- Count unique users and find the highest transaction amount.
- Split transaction details into separate lists.

### Part 3: Unique Data Handling with Sets
- Find users visiting multiple pages and update/remove user IDs as needed.

### Part 4: Data Aggregation with Dictionaries
- Filter and sort user feedback based on ratings.
- Merge feedback from multiple sources.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
